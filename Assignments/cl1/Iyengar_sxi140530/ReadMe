Steps to run the R Script Files:

I ran the scripts using a Ubuntu Operating System in the Command Line,
After downloading the binaries for R in Ubuntu, we should be able to use the Rscript command.

Command syntax:
Rscript <Path of the R Script filename>

Assuming the the script files are in the Path: /home/srikant/Desktop/Iyengar_sxi140530 commands 
for running the script files kyphosis.R and solder.R are as follows:

Rscript /home/srikant/Desktop/Iyengar_sxi140530/kyphosisandsolder.R

****************************************************************************************************************

Expected Output for the Scripts:

The script will generate a pdf file called Rplot.pdf in the directory from where you run the script.
For Example: if I run the above command from the path : /home/srikant , the Rplot.pdf file will be present in the path: 
/home/srikant/Rplots.pdf


This pdf file has 8 graphs which are described below 4 for each of the datasets , the first four for kyphosis and the last four for 
solder dataset.

When we run the script files in the output we will observe the following parts for each dataset:

1) printcp output for the initial model on the entire dataset which includes the CP Table and the rpart formula used.
2) The summary to determine important Attributes that were used in the model ( this is the anser for Question 3 of the assignment). 
3) plot of the original desicion tree. This is the first graph we observe in the pdf file Rplots.pdf
4) printcp output for the pruned tree of the above model.
5) plot of the pruned tree. This is the second graph in the pdf file.
6) printcp of the decision tree that will be split on the basis of 80%-20%.
7) plot of the pruned tree for the above split. This is the 3rd graph in the pdf file.
8) The accuracy for this split.
9) printcp of the decision tree that will be split on the basis of 80%-20%.
10) plot of the pruned tree for the above split. This is the 3rd graph in the pdf file.
11) The accuracy for this split.

Important Attributes for Kyphosis:
Age - 39 
Start - 39 
Number - 23 

Important Attributes for Solder:

skips - 45 
Opening - 24   
Mask - 24 
PadType - 7 

Answer for Question 5 and 6

I ran the above script several time and below is the average accuracy percent for both the models:

Accuracy for Kyphosis for 80 - 20 split: 76.47059
Accuracy for Kyphosis for 90 - 10 split: 88.88889

Accuracy for solder for 80 - 20 split: 73.61111
Accuracy for Kyphosis for 90 - 10 split: 81.94444
